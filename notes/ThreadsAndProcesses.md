# Threads and Processes
By default, programming languages are sequential which means they execute the commands line by line

The most crucial reason for multi-threading is to separate multiple time-consuming tasks that might be subject to interference by execution of other tasks

### What is multi-threading?
Multi-Threading is the ability of the CPU to execute multiple process or threads concurrently

### Process
It is an instance of a Program execution

Each Process has its Registers, Program Counter (PC), Stack Memory and Heap Memory which are assigned by OS

Example : Opening word, browser etc are all different processes

##### Creating a process is an Expensive Operation

### Threads
Thread is essentially a light-weight process.

It is a unit of execution within a given process. So a single process can contain multiple threads

Each thread in a process share the memory and resources and this is why we need to deal with Concurrent Programming
